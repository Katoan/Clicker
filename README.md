##Clicker game
Create a cookie clicker type game, that has all the game data in separate JSON files. Eventually the goal is to create a cookie clicker type game that the user can alter just by altering the data in the files with a ready made tool.
The idea is to set up a system that could be used to generate Cookie Clicker based educational games, in which the person is fed information as he advances in the game. As a test case, I'll be creating files for a game where you need to generate reputation amongst your peers in University, organize your student association and prevent the University from shutting down your major.

Training:
* ~~Create a clicker~~
* ~~Test managing DOM elements with jQuery~~
* ~~Test accessing a JSON file~~

To Do:
* ~~Generate shop item divs with jQuery~~
* ~~Populate shoppables from JSON files~~
* ~~Generate a game object with game data~~
* ~~Set the clicker to click~~
* ~~Set the clicker to range based on items bought from shop~~
* ~~Set the items in the shop to increase in value as more purchases are made~~
* ~~Generate a timer based autoclicker~~
* ~~Generate event based refresh methods to various changing parts of the page~~

To Do MORE!:
* Add other types of items that increase click effect

Fixes:
* Fixed the OWNED list functionality to be more concise
* Fixed the hover and selectability of the shop hovers
* Fixed (poorly, have to check on it later) shop generating infinite number of div elements
